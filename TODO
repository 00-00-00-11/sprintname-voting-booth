missing:
 - refresh auth0 token when it expires
   - runs into difficulties with checkSession() which seems to attempt to validate wrong email address
 - disregard incomplete votes when showing total number of votes on pokemon
 - enable declaring a generation/letter as "closed"/"finalized"
 - fix routing issues with search box:
   - initial search page does not update search box
 - mooie shaded tile toevoegen while loading
 - check react minified warning
 - use dotenv for reading .env file

improvements:
 - Use Firebase objects when they have been ported to 0.18:

 - use Auth0 module http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/kkpoon/elm-auth0/2.0.0/Auth0
 - use date object to calculate default page?

consider:
 - Material Design?
 - swipe images in lightbox?
 - replace tooltips with jQuery.Tooltip ?
 - Bootstrap? https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css
 - LocalStorage? https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/billstclair/elm-localstorage/4.0.2/LocalStorage-SharedTypes
 - shake to display random pokemon :)
