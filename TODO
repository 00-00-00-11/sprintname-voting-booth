missing:
 - listen to database changes (subscriptions?)
 - secure database API
   - use jsonwebtoken on dbserver
 - do something about unrendered animation on messagebox
 - rename messages in terms of things that happened <https://gist.github.com/Chadtech/89d9e085c3c5bf79602cceb53fbd6e31>

improvements:
 - have error message box take its message from state, not from errormessage
 - fix outline css on input text box
 - rename app.js to index.js
 - move all original js from dist/ to src/
 - move keys to their own file
 - consistent names : 
     Commands/Pokemon.elm
     Models/Pokedex.elm
     View/Pokemon.elm

consider:
 - add Mega variants like https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/manectric ?
 - add Alola variants like https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/muk ?
 - Material Design?
