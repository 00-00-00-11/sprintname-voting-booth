missing:
 - secure database API
   - use jsonwebtoken on dbserver
 - do something about unrendered animation on messagebox
 - rename messages in terms of things that happened <https://gist.github.com/Chadtech/89d9e085c3c5bf79602cceb53fbd6e31>

improvements:
 - have error message box take its message from state, not from errormessage
 - fix outline css on input text box
 - move keys to their own file

consider:
 - rename variant files
 - resize variant images
 - Material Design?
