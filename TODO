missing:
 - introduce search results view
 - listen to database changes (subscriptions?)
 - secure database API

improvements:
 - have error message box take its message from state, not from errormessage
 - use jQuery to apply outline styling to span:has(input)
 - see if unknown-user class can be retired
 - can List.head be replaced with this?
	 case list of
	    []      -> []
	    x::xs   -> ..

consider:
 - rename Msgs to Messages
 - add Mega variants like https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/manectric ?
 - add Alola variants like https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/muk ?
